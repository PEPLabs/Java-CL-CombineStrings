# Combine Strings Lab

## Pre-Requisites
- You are expected to review the `String Basics` written lecture prior to working on this lab. If you are not familiar with the concepts being explored in the lab, please make sure to review the study material first.

## Description
In this exercise, you will practice concatenating, or combinging, string values.

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the file `StringUtilities.java`. This file can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review the file's code and code comments for further instructions.

Tasks to complete within the `StringUtilities.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `combine` so that it returns the correct string value.

## Running Tests
If you look within the `src/test/java` folder, you will find the Java class `StringUtilitiesTest.java`. The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files.  

To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode.
